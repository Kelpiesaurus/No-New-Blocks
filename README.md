# No-New-Blocks
This is a vanilla-minus modpack dedicated to peaceful play without adding any modded blocks/items.

The goal: A fun progression without the need to kill any mob, with new methods to obtain all drops. This will place greater importance on fishing, cat gifts, sniffers and wandering traders. Quality-of-life improvements are added to increase enjoyment of building, decoration, exploration, ambiance and inventory management. Blocks and items are limited to only what's available in vanilla but pushed to exceed their original limitations with new blockstates, recipes and behaviors. 

This pack is inspired by ideas implemented in Raspberry Flavoured: The End is removed to eliminate a mostly empty dimension/elytra/the false sense of finishing the game. Villagers & pillagers are removed to eliminate fun-wrecking trade exploits, humanoid clutter and ugly structures. This should make overworld appear more lonely, a blank canvas for players build on.
